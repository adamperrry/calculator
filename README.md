# calculator
Calculator project in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for The Odin Project. Largest Javascript project to date - the code is messy, but it definitely works!

This calculator can be operated by manually clicking or using the keyboard. It should have basic simple calculator functionality, minus paranthetical expressions.

I tried my best to account for every input scenario that could break the calculator or make it ugly - if you find a bug, PLEASE let me know!

This project is my first foray into heavier functional string and array manipulation using Javascript. I kept my initial approach of storing the input into an array, and carrying out operations on that array. That may have made the code a bit clunky as I added more fixes for various input cases and operations, but everything still works!

If I could change anything, I think I would try to refactor a few bits of code that have a large number of nested "If/Else" statements. Additionally, I inconsistently used the ternary operator and If/Else statements, which can make the code a bit difficult to read.

I am open to any suggestions or bug reports!
